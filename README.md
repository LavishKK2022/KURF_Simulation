# KURF_Simulation
An event-driven XR streaming simulator that models local and remote rendering under realistically distributed network latency. It uses a reinforcement learning agent to decide where to render each frame (locally or remotely) using a reward signal based on both latency values and VGG-based similarity to original frames.
